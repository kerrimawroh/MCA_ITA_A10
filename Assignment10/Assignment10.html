            <p>
                “Ka Baibl” is a khasi bible app for Android and iOS operating platforms that provides readers (specifically the khasis), since it is a khasi version, to be able to access their Bible in their hand. </br>                
                As technology continues to revolutionize the way we live our lives, it has also made it easier for us to access spiritual resources digitally. </br></br>                
                The main objective of this app is to provide numerous benefits for those who seek to deepen their relationship with God. It provides easy accessibility to the bible anytime, anyplace, and anywhere, allowing them to fit their devotions into their busy schedules. Moreover, the app’s features of highlighting, bookmarking, and note-taking, allow for better comprehension and retention of scripture.</br></br>
